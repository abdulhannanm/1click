As a 14 Year Old    he had fiddled around with some coding. He quickly gained interest in Python, when he started coding seriously.    He is known as the API king on the streets. They fear him, and the picture above is UC Berkeley. At the age of 12    AbdulHannan was already commited to UC Berkeley. When he turns 18, he will graduate from MSJHS and go to UC Berkeley.    </pre>  </p></figure>{% endblock %}
